# work-day-planner

This program is suppose to be a planner for a typical 9 to 5 workday. 

Here is the link:  https://donk1557.github.io/work-day-planner/

## Header

The top of the page displays the current date and time in {month day, year} and {hour: minutes: seconds} respectively.

## Timeblocks

There is one of these for every hour between 9 AM and 5 PM. The left-hand side shows the particular hour while the middle section is color-coded to reflect hours that have already passed (in grey), the current hour (in red), and hours yet to come (in green). Users can click on the middle section and type any events or notes they would like to recall. The user can then record their response by clicking the blue save button on the right-hand side. The users notes will persist on the page no matter how many times it is refreshed.
